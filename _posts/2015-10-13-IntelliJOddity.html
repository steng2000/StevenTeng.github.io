<body><b>Couple of findings on IntelliJ 14.1.5 running Ubuntu 15.04</b>
<ul>
	Creating a json file foo.json in the IDE, it is listed as <b>foo.json</b> but in the file system it is <b>foo</b>!!<br>
	This is observed on Ubuntu 15.04.<br>
	This can wreck havoc on a variety of things. <br>
	One example: <br>
	Using vertx factory to start verticle using "service:foo.json" The file does not exist.<br>
	Spend hours without getting the expected result.  Discover it only when examining the file system. 
</ul>
